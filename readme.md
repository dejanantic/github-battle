# GitHub Battle -- Check Popular Repos & Battle GitHub Users

React project, displays most popular repos (by specific languages also) and gives you the ability to pit GitHub users in a "brawl" to see who scores more points. I managed to learn a ton and I gained a deeper understanding of how React works and how to use it to build great UIs.

### Main Features

> "Custom" Webpack config

> GitHub API for user and repo data

> "Desktop First" design

> "Render props" pattern used to reshare non-visual logic amongst components (Tooltip component)

> Reusable Loader component

> Light/Dark mode done with React Context

> Routing done with React Router v4

> Code split with React Router v4 for performance gains

> App hosted on Netlify
